Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. 
*If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution1: 
SELECT 
(SELECT distinct Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary Desc
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) as SecondHighestSalary;


Solution2:
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee 
WHERE Salary NOT IN
(SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function Tested:
You could use the LIMIT clause to limit the number of rows displayed
OFFSET x, skip the first x rows
